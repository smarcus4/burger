# burger
A Burger Eating Application With MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM, and Bootstrap

## Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS/Javascript and elements from the Bootstrap framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger to the "Uneating Burgers" list. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on "Devour!", which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
